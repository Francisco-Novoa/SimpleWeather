## Technical Test for Ria

### Description

- Simple weather app made in Reactjs and Gatsby using openweathermap.org as an api

### Instalation

- The application uses gatsby as framework, so long as that program is installed the rest is as simple as
- > npm install
- > npm start

### Working deployment in Netlify [Here](https://jovial-babbage-2be2cf.netlify.app)

### Video of the App working locally [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HLD85yBBRjfCYGJadEl4aaGClVkW8bqD/view?usp=sharing)

### Other considerations

- The styles were designed with a mobile app in mind and look best in that configuration

#### Made using an [oficial example made by Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/gatsby) as a boiler plate
